# Pathfinding Visualizer

View app at: https://raaghavaadithya.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/

This app allows us to visualize the pathfinding algorithms to search for a path between a starting node and an ending node, through a series of obstacles. We can either use the BFS or A* pathfinding algorithms to perform the search.
